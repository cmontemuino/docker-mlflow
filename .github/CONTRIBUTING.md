# Contributing to the MLflow Docker Image

Community contributions are welcomed! This page describes what you need to do.

## Pull Requests

Here are some helpful guidelines to keep in mind when contributing.  While following them isn't absolutely required, it does help everyone to accept your pull-requests with maximum awesomeness.

- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** keep pull requests small so they can be easily reviewed.
- :heavy_check_mark: **DO** make sure there is an open issue associated with what you are trying to merge.
- :x: **AVOID** breaking the continuous integration build.

## Contribution Standards

Don't be afraid to contribute! Even if you don't think you've contributed much, it's still greatly appreciated.

- Use a commit message of the format `Explanation of what changed..`. The first line of commit messages should not be longer than 70 characters. Any subsequent lines should not be longer than 80 characters.
- Please follow [Linus Torvald's recommendation](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/a48494d2fbed58c751e9b7e8fbff88582f9b2d02/README#L88) for writing git commit messages. Please avoid using past tense, but simple present tense.
- An explanation of what the commit's changes do in your commit message is extremely useful. It helps people to more quickly understand what your code is doing.
- When you submit a pull request, be willing to accept criticism. We don't criticize to make you feel bad - we want you to know where you may have made a mistake and this helps you grow as a developer.
